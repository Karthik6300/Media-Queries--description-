            Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants, also
            known as angiosperms. They are vital to plant reproduction,
            facilitating pollination and the production of seeds. A typical
            flower consists of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens (male
            reproductive organs), and carpels (female reproductive organs).
            Sepals protect the budding flower, while petals often attract
            pollinators with their vibrant colors and fragrances. Stamens
            produce pollen, and carpels contain ovules that develop into seeds
            after fertilization. These parts work together to ensure the
            survival and propagation of plant species.

            Rock pyramids, also known as cairns, are human-made stacks of
            stones, often arranged in a conical or pyramid shape. These
            structures have been used throughout history and across cultures for
            various purposes, such as navigation markers, spiritual symbols, or
            memorials. Built by carefully balancing stones of different sizes,
            cairns range from simple piles to elaborate towers. In ancient
            times, they were used to guide travelers in treacherous terrains,
            especially in deserts or mountainous regions where landmarks were
            scarce. Today, rock pyramids are also a popular symbol of balance,
            patience, and harmony in nature.

            A water glass is a common vessel used for drinking water, typically
            made of materials such as glass, plastic, or stainless steel. It
            comes in various shapes and sizes, often designed for functionality
            and aesthetic appeal. Clear glass versions are popular for their
            simplicity and ability to showcase the clarity of water, while
            insulated or double-walled designs are favored for keeping water
            cool for extended periods. The water glass is a staple in homes,
            restaurants, and workplaces, reflecting the universal need for
            hydration and the importance of clean drinking water.
